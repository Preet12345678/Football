     <P><h3>What are the rules?<br>
         Football has many rules.Some of them are that kick-off is taken from the halfway line.When the ball has gone off the pitch it is either an throw in or a corner kick. When you slide tackle but don't get the ball it is either a yellow or red car depending on how severe the foul was. A match is played by two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players; one must be the goalkeeper.</h3>
